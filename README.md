### Hi there, La-Sian here ðŸ‘‹

I'm new to the tech scene and yet, about to dive straight into a 16 week course with the School of Code! I am excited and equally nervous for the journey ahead. 

 Iâ€™m currently learning html and css on Freecodecamp and Codeacademy and I am looking forward to sharing my progress and future projects!
